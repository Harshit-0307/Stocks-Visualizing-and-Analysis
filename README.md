# Stocks-Visualizing-and-Analysis
There are total 3 folders in the project.
    1) Code
    2) Datasets
    3) Cleaned Datasets

Also there is one dashboard file where we have used the dash library to create a visualisation toolbox.

In the code folder we have done Data Cleaning, then the analysis of the individual companies. Also the combined analysis file is made to to do the combined analysis of all the companies.

The csv generated after cleaning the dataset is stored in the Cleaned Dataset folder.
